          <h1>News Inequality: A Demo</h1>
          <p class="text-muted">By <a href="http://www.hamdanazhar.com/" _target="blank">Hamzan Ahzar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cthydng" _target="blank">Cathy Deng</a>, <a href="http://christianmilneil.com/" _target="blank">Christian MilNeil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/morisy" _target="blank">Michael Morisy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lmshap" _target="blank">Leslie Shapiro</a></p>
          <p>This is a quick project built during the <a href="http://www.misinfocon.com/" target="_blank">Misinfocon</a> creative studio.</p>

          <p>Media organizations often have blind spots in their coverage. Newsrooms naturally follow where they think the news is, chasing breaking news and covering human interest stories as they come to the attention of reporters and editors. But this natural inclination often leaves them open to missing stories or misappropriating resources without even realizing it. The amount - and type - of coverage that different neighborhoods get isn't always fair or ideal.</p>

          <p>While itâ€™s hard to see these disparities on a day-to-day basis, over time they build up, leaving some neighborhoods over-covered or under-covered. Longer-term datasets can reveal patterns and help surface those blind spots.</p>

          <p>In an ideal world, media organizations would participate in these forms of self-reflection - however, if that doesn't happen, public accountability & critique from outside parties can push media organizations to be more equitable in their reporting.</p>

          <h2>Example #1: Williamsburg vs Marine Park</h2>
          <p>[intro about williamsburg & marine park]</p>
          <p>We looked at articles on the Gothamist tagged "Marine Park" or "Williamsburg" & grabbed the text of the headlines.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <img src="static/images/gothamist_marinepark_wordcloud.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-6">
              <img src="static/images/gothamist_williamsburg_wordcloud.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>These are words used in headlines about Marine Park & headlines about Williamsburg.</p>
          <p>All of these articles are reporting facts - <b>however, in aggregate, factual stories can still paint an incomplete and misleading picture of the neighborhood</b>.</p>
