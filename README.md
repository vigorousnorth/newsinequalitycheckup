The problem: disproportionality in news coverage
------------------------------------------------

* Spatial inequality in news coverage -- are communities getting covered equally? Are certain communities being overlooked?
* Transparency/accountability by news orgs -- how can news orgs audit their coverage for gaps?

This is a problem because it's relevant to trust
------------------------------------------------

* who is any given media organization alienating?

* it's harder to trust an organization if you don't see yourself or your community represented

* are communities that get fewer journalism resources more susceptible to disinformation?


Solution: A set of tools to analyze equality in coverage
--------------------------------------------------------

* articles per capita
* what are the most attention-grabbing places, & how much of total coverage do they account for?
* finding discrepancies in types of content between different places
* Make journalists aware of their blind spots, where their coverage is lacking
* Visualizing coverage areas/types as a proof of concept, which could potentially lead to developing a repeatable tool and/or framework for news organizations (or communities) to audit gaps in their local coverage

 We'd like to develop a tool for newsrooms and civic advocates to assess local news coverage and promote more equitable distribution of journalism resources
